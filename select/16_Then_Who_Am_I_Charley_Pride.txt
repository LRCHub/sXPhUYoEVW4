If he's the one that's always on your mind
The only one whose love can satisfy
If he's the one that keeps your heart alive
Then who am I? (Who am I?) Who am I?

Am I no more than just a rock you needed for a stepping stone
Until the right one came along
If he's the one that live with you inside
Then who am I? (Who am I?) Who am I?

Am I no more than just a fool that held you up when you were down
Until your true love could be found
If he's the one that live with you inside
Then who am I? (Who am I?) Who am I?

Yes who am I? (Who am I?) Who am I?
